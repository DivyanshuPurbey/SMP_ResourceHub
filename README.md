# SMP

No good understanding can ever be brought without the skillful notes; thus, SMP contributed as an open-source platform for archiving one of the best notes and books for all the students of MNNIT.

Resource Hub aimed at providing notes to all for depth in understanding and bringing transparency in the concepts.

Here is the new version of SMP Resource Hub, which is better, updated and more sorted.
